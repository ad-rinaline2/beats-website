			       <p>If you are not looking to use this for VoIP calls (Skype/Chime/Zoom etc) on PC (Desktop/Laptop) , 
				   skip this review. There are plenty of other reviews on sound quality and noise cancellation and personally 
				   I am happy with these aspects. Just my luck that I primarily bought this for conference calls on my laptop and 
				   it was too late until I found out that there is a known , unresolvable technical issue with Beats headphones when 
				   it comes to taking conference calls via PC (laptop/desktop). The call connects fine but drops after a 
				   few mins (for some its 15 mins, others 30/60 mins). This happens every single time. 
				   If you go to Beats tech support forums, there are 2-3 solutions you will read about 
				   (disable auto-off settings, update firmware, reboot aah the personal favorite of tech support when there is 
				   no solution!). There is a small problem though - None of them works. And you will find dozens of people on google 
				   search who have encountered the same problem. I love(d) Beats, but this is completely unacceptable. 
				   With more and more people starting to work from home and attending calls online, I am sure one of 2 things 
				   will happen by end of this year - Either Beats will take ownership of resolving this bug or they will experience 
				   a drop in brand value, loyalty and sales. The sales will eventually pick up once Beats fixes this issue in a new 
				   model for new customers, but the scars on the brand will remain for a longer period because Beats is not accepting 
				   this as their issue and blaming it on conference call software or customer device/settings issue.</p>

			       <p>Oh yeah! This is the best Rs 30K I’ve ever spent. I’m in rural Bengal. 
				   I have temple close to me that often blasts totally illegal loudspeaker techno rave music sometimes until one in the morning, I have a kid next door who practices his loud drum when the rest of the world is trying to take an afternoon nap, there is a hotel near by with bar that can emit techno music so loud it sounds like it’s coming from inside my room, and don’t get me started about the guy across the garden who gets drunk and screams for an hour at his poor wife. I put these Beats headsets on and the ONLY thing I hear is my own tinnitus humming in my ears. I took a walk just now out in the garden with the temple techno rave music blasting on a Saturday afternoon, and with these Beats on, it was silent. Silent!! This is a better investment than my new motorcycle or computer.
				   Can’t believe I was too cheap to buy this before, these are just the best.</p>
